# WSO-Config
The new server setup for WSO's infrastructure.

## Onboarding
You will need to install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), which you can do with:
`$ brew install ansible` on macOS, or `pip install ansible` anywhere. On Linux it's in your package manager.

You will also need something to manage VMs. You can get [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) on macOS or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) on Windows and Linux. 

Go get a copy of [AlmaLinux 9](https://almalinux.org)'s ISO image, then do a barebones vanilla install into the VM. (TODO: just use/make stock container images instead)
## Building
(TODO: give Ansible build instructions)

## Directory Structure
(TODO: decide on how we'll structure this, and move over some parts from the WSO-Go config into this)
